ESE516 - IoT Edge Computing Final Project (IoT Based Smart Street Lighting System)

I designed an IoT based smart street lighting system with the main goal of saving power. It activates the street light after sensing the conditions of the environment. The system was built upon the ATSAMW25 module that consists of the MCU and the WINC1500 Wifi chip. It consists of the Temperature & Humidity Sensor that triggers the street light under rough foggy and misty weather conditions. The Ambient Light sensor measures the lux value of a location. Below a lux value, the street light is turned on. We also have a motion sensor that detects the entry of the vehicle. The entire system was built and tested on a custom PCB. We also have a repair light system to use another light if the main light enters maintenance mode. Once the main light enters into maintenance mode, a notification is sent to the appropriate authorities for action.
